# Heady™ AI — HeadyJules MCP Integration

## Setup for Heady™Jules Desktop

Add to `~/.config/headyjules/claude_desktop_config.json`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "heady": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "heady-mcp-server"],
      "env": {
        "HEADY_URL": "http://127.0.0.1:3301"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Restart HeadyJules Desktop. You now have 10 Heady tools available in every conversation.

## Setup for Heady™Jules Projects

Create a Project with these instructions:

```
You have access to the Heady™ Intelligence Layer via MCP tools. When the user
asks questions, use the appropriate Heady service group:

- heady_swarm — for broad research or multi-perspective tasks
- heady_code — for coding tasks (refactors, tests, migrations)
- heady_battle — to validate changes for regressions/security
- heady_creative — for creative content generation
- heady_simulate — for scenario analysis and planning
- heady_audit — for policy/security audits
- heady_brain — for deep reasoning and meta-analysis
- heady_analyze — for code/text analysis
- heady_chat — for general conversation

Always use the most specific tool for the task.
```
