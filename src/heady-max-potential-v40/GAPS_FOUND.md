## Critical Gaps

### 1. "Eric Head" Reference (Identity Error)
- **File:** `11-HEADY_CONTEXT.md` line 9
- **Found:** `Founder: Eric Head (eric-head / headyme)`
- **Required:** `Founder: Eric Haywood`
- **Status:** FLAGGED — requires correction in source repo

### 2. localhost References in Production Config
- `14-drupal-config/.../HeadyCmsSettingsForm.php:65` — default `http://localhost:3010`
- `14-drupal-config/.../BrowserAutomationService.php:32` — fallback `http://localhost:3010`
- `14-drupal-config/.../HeadyAdminController.php:181` — checking `localhost:8081`
- `14-drupal-config/.../HeadyConfigController.php:77` — `http://localhost:8080`
- `12-heady-registry.json:13` — `http://localhost:3300` endpoint
- `12-heady-registry.json:982` — `http://localhost:3300` endpoint
- **Impact:** Violates Law 5 (Cross-Environment Purity)
- **Fix:** Replace with `process.env.*_URL` or domain-router resolution

### 3. Wildcard CORS (`Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *`)
- `14-drupal-config/.../HeadyConfigController.php:94` and `:121`
- **Impact:** Allows any domain to make authenticated requests
- **Fix:** Explicit origin whitelist for 9 Heady domains

### 4. console.log in Production Code
- `14-drupal-config/.../admin.js:18` — `console.log('✅ Status refreshed:', data)`
- `14-drupal-config/.../headylens.js:80` — `console.log('🔭 HeadyLens WebSocket connected')`
- **Fix:** Replace with structured JSON logger

### 5. TODO Comment (Incomplete Implementation)
- `07-auth-manager.js:330` — `// TODO: exchange code with provider token endpoint`
- **Impact:** OAuth code exchange is not implemented
- **Fix:** Complete OAuth flow with proper token exchange

### 6. Empty/Silent Catch Blocks
- `09-swarm-coordinator.js:505` — `catch (_) {}`
- `06-vector-memory.js:179` — `.catch(() => {})`
- `05-heady-auto-context.js` — 8 instances of `catch (_)` with no logging
- **Fix:** Log errors to structured logger, emit to observability-kernel

### 7. Priority/Ranking Language (Violates Concurrent-Equals)
- `10-seventeen-swarm-orchestrator.js` — 20+ references to `priority`, `PRIORITY.HIGH`, `PRIORITY.LOW`, priority-based queue sorting
- **Impact:** Contradicts concurrent-equals architecture (ADR-008)
- **Fix:** Replace with CSL confidence scoring without starvation

### 8. Magic Numbers (Not φ-Scaled)
- Hardcoded ports: 3300, 3301, 8080, 8081 throughout Drupal config
- `setTimeout` with round numbers: 2000, 3000, 5000ms
- `heartbeatMs: 5000 * (1 + priority/200)` — arbitrary formula
- `maxAuditEntries: 50000` — should be FIB-based
- `timeout: 5000` in bee-factory
- **Fix:** Replace all with φ-math constants from @heady/phi-math-foundation
