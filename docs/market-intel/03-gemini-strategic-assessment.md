## ✅ Already Implemented (Confirmed Aligned)

| Capability | Heady Component |
|---|---|
| DAG-based orchestration | `heady-conductor.js` (federated routing) |
| Dynamic model fallback/racing | Gateway race architecture (4+ providers) |
| Secret scanning | `.git/hooks/pre-commit` (16 patterns) |
| Human-in-the-loop controls | `governance-policies.yaml` (destructive ops gating) |
| Model drift detection | `hc_scientist.js` (consistency scans, drift thresholds) |
| Stateful workflow resilience | `hc_pipeline.js` (circuit breaker, checkpoints, task cache) |
| QA engine | `hc_qa.js` (16 endpoint probes, schema validation) |
| Cost/budget tracking | HeadyGateway budget caps (daily/monthly) |
| Sacred geometry UX | HeadyBuddy (φ-ratio animations) |
| Immutable audit trails | `hc_scientist.js` audit logs, conductor audit |
| Continuous self-optimization | `self-optimizer.js` (φ-interval benchmarking) |
| Multi-agent orchestration | `agent-orchestrator.js`, conductor routing table |

## 🎯 Net-New Actionable Items

### 1. Supply Chain Security

- **Dependabot/Renovate**: Enable automated dependency PR updates for `package.json` across all repos
- **SECURITY.md**: Create responsible disclosure policy at repo root
- **GitHub Code Scanning**: Enable SAST on PRs via GitHub Actions

### 2. Release Engineering

- **release-please**: Automate semantic versioning from conventional commits
- **Monorepo build caching**: Evaluate Turborepo/Nx for selective rebuilds (only changed modules)

### 3. Infrastructure

- **Redis state store**: Add persistent state for long-running workflows (resume-on-failure for multi-step agent tasks beyond current in-memory checkpoints)
- **Helm charts**: Package K8s deployments if/when moving beyond PM2 + Cloudflare Workers

### 4. Governance Hardening

- **RBAC with scoped tokens**: AI agents get temporary, narrowly-scoped access to APIs per-task instead of ambient credentials
- **Approval queues in Heady Manager UI**: Visual gate for high-stakes autonomous actions (financial txns, contract finalization, production DB writes)

### 5. Commercial Verticals (Highest ROI Targets)

| Vertical | Why Heady Fits | Entry Cost | Moat |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Corporate Procurement** | Autonomous RFx, spend analysis, contract mgmt — HeadyConductor + Gateway can orchestrate these workflows | $100K–200K | Very High — compresses 6-month RFP to 27 days |
| **Legal & Compliance** | Zero-hallucination doc review, audit trails (already have immutable logging) | $60K–150K | High — domain data + HITL required |
| **Finance & Insurance** | Risk scoring, fraud detection — HeadyBattle validation + Scientist drift detection map directly | $70K–200K | High — compliance (SOX, PCI DSS) |
| **Logistics/Manufacturing** | IoT integration, predictive maintenance — real-time event loop architecture already proven | $50K–150K | High — physical world impact |

### 6. Website UX Upgrades

- **"Receipt" UI pattern**: Every AI action shows routing decision + model used + cost + validation score + tools invoked. Add to admin dashboard as a per-request audit card
- **Live ROI calculator**: Add to headysystems.com showing hours saved / risk averted per automated workflow
- **"System Pulse" homepage**: Replace static landing with sanitized live telemetry from HeadyConductor
- **Arena Merge visualization**: Interactive split-screen on headyos.com showing HeadyBattle consensus

### 7. Financial Planning Benchmarks

- **OpEx baseline**: $3.2K–$13K/month for mid-complex enterprise AI agent system
- **Annual maintenance reserve**: 15–20% of initial dev budget for retraining/optimization
- **Token cost tracking**: Already have budget in Gateway — surface it in dashboard with trend charts
